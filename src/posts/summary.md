**Re:Mind** is a scalable collaborative adaptation strategy to an already evident crisis, designed as a three-phase project that digitally captures and makes accessible the threatened cultural heritage of Africa, Oceania, and Central America. It will establish a global knowledge environment that adopts, augments, and activates this unique heritage for human learning. Large-scale digitization of climate-threatened cultural heritage will be unified with cutting-edge technology to create vibrant, nuanced, and comprehensive narratives presently hidden and unheard. It will bring together living social networks—actual regional and institutional communities of students, teachers, and other independent and curious individuals—through transnational curriculum development, comprehensive training, exchange opportunities, fellowships, and iterative sharing of new discoveries.

Culture, integral to human purpose and identity, is rarely considered in the assessment of climatological loss. Re:Mind sustains this integrity. Animating cultural heritage requires ongoing learning of intergenerational knowledge to share forward historical cultural techniques – songs, creations, ways of being, and non-written heritage transfer.

Chief goals of the project include: 

* Long-term animation and augmentation of presently hidden and inaccessible assets of human ingenuity and insight, including rare and unique cultural and scientific artifacts and documentation; 
* Proof of a scalable methodology that insists on the interdependence of global communities of practice, assisted by technology, that can serve as paradigm for future collaborative responses that mitigate the deleterious consequences of human agency in the Anthropocene; 
* A behavioral model that confirms the positive effects of well-managed, large scale human agency encouraging similar collective responses to climate change.

        Listen Ocol, my old friend, <br />
        The ways of your ancestors <br />
        Are good, <br />
        Their customs are solid<br />
        And not hollow<br />
        They are not thin, not easily breakable<br />
        They cannot be blown away<br />
        By the winds<br />
        Because their roots reach deep<br />
        into the soil.
