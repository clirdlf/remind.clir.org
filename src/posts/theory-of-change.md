We share the conviction that access to cultural heritage is essential to human well-being. Today, the survival of many cultural sites, properties, and traditions is under threat due to the climate crisis, disproportionately in under-resourced areas of the world. Digital preservation is one strategy for limiting the harmful consequences of lost culture, while digital access can amplify the benefits of learning through exposure to cultural heritage for people everywhere.

Recognizing the need for a coordinated approach to preserving and creating access to culture under threat, our project aims to implement a replicable model for strengthening climate resilience centered on cultural heritage preservation in Sub-Saharan Africa, Oceania, and Central America, using shared technologies as the means and community-based partnerships as the model for inclusive cultural preservation. We posit that by empowering communities of practice with technical and practical skills and access to digital infrastructures, we can create a causal link between our interventions and improved inter-cultural understanding and community resilience in the face of climate threats. Our approach is grounded in research on the importance of community-led initiatives, the impact of digitization on cultural preservation, and the need for climate resilience planning in vulnerable regions. In addition to an external evaluation, we will engage fellows in participatory action research and digital storytelling; iteratively develop  shared infrastructures including a modular training curriculum; and monitor the effectiveness of our interventions by collecting case studies and conducting interviews and surveys.
