We share the conviction that access to oneâ€™s own cultural heritage is essential to human well-being. Today, substantial amounts of cultural sites, properties, and traditions are under threat due to the climate crisis, disproportionately in under-resourced areas of the world. Digital preservation is one strategy for limiting the harmful consequences of lost culture, while digital access can amplify the benefits of learning through exposure to cultural heritage for people everywhere.

Recognizing the need for a coordinated approach to preserving and creating access to culture under threat, our project aims to implement a replicable model for climate resilience planning centered on cultural heritage preservation in organizations and communities within Africa, the South Pacific, and Central America, using countries in Sub-Saharan Africa as the starting point, shared technologies as the means, and community-based partnerships as the model for inclusive cultural preservation. We posit that by empowering communities of practice with technical and practical skills and easy access to digitization equipment, we can create a causal link between our interventions and improved social cohesion and community resilience in the face of climate threats. Our approach is grounded in research on the importance of community-led initiatives, the impact of digitization on cultural preservation, and the need for climate resilience planning in vulnerable communities. We will employ participatory action research; iterative development of a shared digital infrastructure; a flexible, modular training curriculum; and community-based assessments that include case studies, interviews, and surveys to evaluate the effectiveness of our interventions and inform future improvements.
