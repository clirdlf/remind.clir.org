Our project aims to develop and implement a replicable model for climate resilience planning and cultural heritage preservation in institutions and communities across Africa, the South Pacific, and Central America, using countries in Africa as a testbed for a global initiative. Our theory of change aims to promote inclusive knowledge ecosystems that prioritize community-led initiatives, cultural preservation, and decolonized scholarship. We posit that by empowering communities of practice with technical skills, metadata expertise, and access to digitization labs, we can create a causal link between our interventions and improved community resilience. Our approach is grounded in research on the importance of community-led initiatives, the impact of digitization on cultural heritage preservation, and the need for climate resilience planning in vulnerable communities. We will employ methodologies such as participatory action research, community-based assessments, capacity building and training, case studies, and surveys to evaluate the effectiveness of our interventions and inform future improvements.
