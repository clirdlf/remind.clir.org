The results of a 2023 survey of cultural heritage organizations within Sub-Saharan Africa indicate that technical capacity–including staffing, training, and infrastructure–currently inhibits the stewardship of cultural resources in the region. Re:Mind is designed to address this gap. The project will not only broadly impact cultural heritage preservation, it will profoundly affect organizations and populations vulnerable to climate-related disasters by focusing on capacity building in those areas. By empowering leaders and groups to shape how their own cultural heritage is captured, described, shared, and maintained over time, the knowledge and experiences of these populations can be preserved even while the environments surrounding them change beyond recognition. 

This project aims to serve communities around the world, with a particular emphasis on:

Regions vulnerable to climate-related disasters;
Local communities taking ownership of their cultural heritage; and
Stakeholders who are interested in promoting cultural understanding and collaboration.

The benefits and outcomes of Re:Mind include:

Preservation of cultural heritage: A significant increase in the number of preserved cultural heritage items within at least 200 organizations and communities, with a particular emphasis on reaching communities facing climate threats.
Capacity building and training: Community-led preservation initiatives will receive technical support and capacity building through training programs, ensuring they have the skills, equipment, and knowledge needed to preserve and promote their cultural knowledge effectively.
Global understanding and collaboration: by promoting the dissemination and use of endangered cultural heritage through fellowships, exchange programs, and symposia, the program will cultivate a worldwide network well positioned to collaborate on issues related to cultural preservation as well as community and climate resilience.

To ensure progress is being made, the following indicators will be used:

The number of community-led preservation initiatives established and supported;
The increase in the number of preserved cultural heritage items documenting climate-threatened populations;
Feedback from communities and stakeholders on the effectiveness and impact of the project’s  training program;
Evaluation reports documenting the experiences of participants and stakeholders in the project,

To ensure long-term sustainability, Re:Mind will develop a scaling-up plan to support a minimum of 100 additional community-led preservation initiatives across the globe over the decade following its implementation. This expansion will be achieved through continuing to establish strategic partnerships with governments, universities, national libraries, funding agencies, and community-based organizations.

By monitoring these indicators, we will be able to assess the progress made through Re:Mind over the initial five-year period to make adjustments as needed, ensuring that needs are being met and the solution is adaptable to new climate-threatened populations with different needs.

## Technical Process

Our scalable digital preservation frameworks will safeguard and provide long-term access to cultural heritage content. These frameworks will employ a modular service-oriented architecture (SOA) to afford flexibility and facilitate collaborative maintenance. UbuntuNet Alliance will work with digital library development leaders including Princeton University Libraries and Stanford University Libraries to establish systems for the following:

Hosting: Assist organizations that do not have hosting capabilities with sharing new digital collections;

Metadata Management: Provide Apache Solr and Apache Airflow for metadata harvesting, extraction, and transformation;

Digital Object Store: Employ both S3 compatible services and local storage and replication as scalable, cloud-based object stores for digital artifacts that can protect indigenous data sovereignty;

Preservation Services: Implement a suite of preservation services based upon the Open Archival Information System (OAIS) reference model and LOCKSS principals, including Ingest (Apache Airflow, Apache NiFi), Validation (Apache Jena), and Replication (LOCKSS, Apache Cassandra);

Discovery and Access Services: Leverage Project Blacklight and Spotlight for digital artifact discovery using Apache Solr as a discovery backend;

International standards: Adopt and provide training in implementing standards for digital capture, semantic interoperability (using linked open vocabularies), preservation interoperability (LOCKSS and preservation APIs), legal interoperability (RightsStatements.org and Creative Commons), computational and algorithmic interoperability (advanced quantitative methods for database links and interrogation), and data reuse and sustainability (Linked Open Usable Data, or LOUD).

Grounded in FAIR data principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable), this approach will enable the efficient management and preservation of large-scale cultural heritage collections while ensuring long-term sustainability and accessibility.
