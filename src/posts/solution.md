Re:Mind empowers communities to preserve cultural heritage in the face of climate-related disasters through community-driven digitization, leadership, and thoughtfully designed digital technologies. By leveraging CLIR's expertise in community mobilization, leadership and skills training, collaboratively developed technologies, and large-scale preservation of rare and unique materials, . Re:Mind will establish complementary and globally scalable programs that capture, share, and activate hidden and endangered knowledge for current and future generations.

Over five years, Re:Mind will stimulate the preservation of at-risk cultural heritage over three phases:

* **Phase 1: Mobilization (Year 1)** - Working with global partners and cultural heritage practitioners in target areas, collaboratively design and test a flexible and modular training curriculum about cultural heritage preservation and use suited to the needs, conditions, and priorities of communities most affected by the climate crisis. Project partners will cultivate networks of skilled practitioners capable of adapting and implementing this curriculum to advance digital access to rare and unique collections in target areas as well as stand up shared technical systems capable of preserving and maintaining access to that content over time.
* **Phase 2: Implementation – Africa and Diaspora (Years 2-3):** By adapting, expanding,delivering training modules both online and in person within Sub-Saharan Africa and also within Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) within the US, this phase will build capacity for the digitization and promulgation of rare and unique content related to the histories of Sub-Saharan Africa and the African diaspora, offering training, equipment, and storage for digitized content. To complement these capacity-building activities, short- and long-term fellowship and exchange programs suited to the needs of Africa-based and US librarians, archivists, researchers, students, and community representatives will provide opportunities to advance digital preservation, promote the creative use of digitized materials for research, journalism, and public programming, and widely disseminate new insights and discoveries about the histories of Sub-Saharan Africa and the African diaspora. Geographically distributed teams will bring both digital library and cultural expertise to the delivery and ongoing assessment of the curriculum, fellowships, and shared digital infrastructure. The project will support 50–70 preservation initiatives during this phase. . Additionally, we will apply lessons learned during this phase to planning the expansion of the program for Phase 3..
* **Phase 3: Implementation – South Pacific and Central America (Years 4-5)** - Parallel training, leadership development, outreach, and digital infrastructure development programs will be established in two additional target regions during this phase. These programs will significantly increase preserved cultural heritage content while contributing to the global network of interconnected librarians, archivists, scholars, students, officials, and community representatives committed to harnessing digital technologies to preserve and share climate-threatened heritage. An estimated 100-150 preservation initiatives will be supported during this phase. At the same time, the project’s open and free curriculum will be made available worldwide in multiple languages in order to strengthen both awareness of the need to preserve the heritage of climate-threatened communities and the capacity to undertake this work collaboratively, using shared systems and standards.  The conclusion of this phase will coincide with a capstone symposium designed to advance further expansion of the programs into other climate-threatened areas of the globe.

Re:Mind will broadly impact cultural heritage preservation, but it will most profoundly and intensely affect communities vulnerable to climate-related disasters. By empowering organizations and leaders in these areas to shape how their own cultural heritage is captured, described, shared, and maintained over time, the knowledge and experiences of these vulnerable populations can be preserved even while the environments surrounding them change beyond recognition. 

This project aims to serve communities around the world, with a particular emphasis on:

* Marginalized communities that are vulnerable to climate-related disasters
* Local communities that are taking ownership of their cultural heritage and preservation initiatives
* Stakeholders who are interested in promoting cultural understanding and collaboration

The benefits and outcomes of Re:Mind include:

* Preservation of cultural heritage: A significant increase in the number of preserved cultural heritage items, with a particular on reaching marginalized communities 
* Capacity building and training: Community-led preservation initiatives will receive technical support and capacity building through training programs, ensuring they have the skills, equipment, and knowledge needed to preserve and promote their cultural knowledge effectively.
* Global understanding and collaboration: by promoting the dissemination and use of endangered cultural heritage through fellowships, exchange programs, and symposia, the program will cultivate a worldwide network well positioned to collaborate on issues related to cultural preservation as well as community and climate resilience.

To ensure progress is being made, the following indicators will be used:

* The number of community-led preservation initiatives established and supported
* The increase in the number of preserved cultural heritage items documenting climate-threatened populations
Feedback from communities and stakeholders on the effectiveness and impact of the project’s  training program
* Evaluation reports from partners documenting the experiences of participants and stakeholders in the capacity building, leadership, and infrastructure development programs established through this project

To ensure long-term sustainability, Re:Mind will develop a scaling-up plan to support a minimum of  100 additional community-led preservation initiatives across the globe over the decade following its implementation. This expansion will be achieved through continuing to establish strategic partnerships with governments, universities, national libraries, funding agencies, and community-based organizations.

By monitoring these indicators and implementing a scaling-up strategy, we will be able to assess the progress made through Re:Mind over the initial five-year period to make adjustments as needed, ensuring that needs are being met and the solution is adaptable to new climate-threatened populations with different needs and desires.
