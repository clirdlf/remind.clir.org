Re:Mind is a three-phase project that will capture and make accessible threatened cultural heritage of Sub-Saharan Africa, South Pacific, and Central America. It will establish a global knowledge environment that adopts, augments, and activates this unique heritage for human learning. Large-scale digitization of climate-threatened cultural heritage will be unified with cutting-edge technology to create vibrant, nuanced, and comprehensive narratives presently hidden and unheard. Living social networks—actual regional and institutional communities of students, teachers, and other independent and curious individuals–through intercontinental curriculum development, comprehensive training, exchange opportunities, fellowships, and iterative sharing of new discoveries.

Culture, integral to human purpose and identity, is rarely considered in the assessment of climatological loss. Re:Mind sustains this integrity.

Chief goals of the project include: 

* Long-term animation and augmentation of presently hidden and inaccessible assets of human ingenuity and insight, including rare and unique cultural and scientific artifacts and documentation; 
* Proof of a scalable methodology that insists on the interdependence of global communities of practice, assisted by technology, that can serve as paradigm for future collaborative responses that mitigate the deleterious consequences of human agency in the Anthropocene; 
* A behavioral model that bolsters the longer-term survival of our collective legacy.

    Listen Ocol, my old friend, <br />
    The ways of your ancestors <br />
    Are good, <br />
    Their customs are solid<br />
    And not hollow<br />
    They are not thin, not easily breakable<br />
    They cannot be blown away<br />
    By the winds<br />
    Because their roots reach deep<br />
    into the soil.
